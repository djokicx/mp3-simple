Project 4

Files:
Func.java
MPlayerPanel.java
PlayerThread.java
PlaySong.java
Song.java
read_me.txt

This was by far the most interesting project this semester. 
Although it was very challenging, it was really fun. 
MPlayerPanel.java sets the GUI for the program. 
If any of the buttons from the GUI are pressed it calls the methods from Func.java.
All the functions are explained within the program. 
The biggest issue I had was with the ArrayList and emptying it after each load mp3 or load library are pressed. 
However, I realized I just need to call ArrayList<>.clear before calling any methods.
Class song.java stores artist, title, album and path strings. 
This way it is easy to manipulate these tags within the ArrayList of Songs. 
PlayerThread.java and PlaySong.java play the song.
I also did the extra credit with searching songs by artist and by title, specifying the location of song library when storing and saving, and saving as an XML file. 
For this reason I added three external jars.
A very good project!
